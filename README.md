# Motospeed CK62 60% Mechanical Keyboard

### Instalation

If you're own the CK62 keyboard, this `json` file may help you fix the Layer problem on a `Mac OS X` environment.

* First you need to install `Karabiner`, use this [link](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)
* Then you need to copy the `customCK62.json` to the Karabiner directory, using the command below:
  * `$cp customCK62.json ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications`

After that, just open `Karabiner` and activate this rule. If you need any assistant on that, please follow this [guide](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/docs/).
